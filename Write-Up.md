In this lab, I have managed to complete code that was efficient enought to design a website, make it run, and apply it to a live server. The basic code runs through Javascript, a file that just makes the website exist. From there, there is an HTML file that sets up the basic website from there.  Finally, a bit of CSS code is used to style the website into something a little more asthetically pleasing.

This is one of three files that I used to code out this website. With the inclusion of this CSS file, I also used an HTML file and a JS (Javascript) file in order to proplery order and serve this website.  Within the Javascript file was some very base level code that allowed for the website to be recognized and propely set as a website.  In the HTML file, the coding language of HTML was used in order to set up the base look and structure of the website.  The CSS file used here was actually only used to stylize what the website would look like.

On this screenshot, it is seen that the website is up and running, and it is visually different from the base level website we initally started with.  At the beginning, there was a very blank page with black and white text and boxes, and now it can be seen that it has been changed to a nice aquamarine color palet.  Along with that, the CSS and HTML combine nicely to create working check-off buttons and sort buttons.  With this, there is also a section to 'Create Task', which prompts the user to insert a task and give it a due date as well.

## Questions 1a

What is the purpose of using Docker containers?

The purpose of using Docker containers is to be able to run a program in an isolated environment, in this case, to run a webiste on a local environment.

Why is it useful to have both a development environment and a live server environment?

One of the biggest reasons it is great to have both environments is basic debugging.  If something shows up in the live server then it can be changed and modified on the local, then ported over to the live server to see if the changes actually fixed the problem.

What is the purpose of using a code versioning tool (i.e. Git)?

One of the biggest reasons for code versioning tools is to track version hisotry and changes.  Another big reason is to be able to work on the same files from different environments from different devices.

## Questions 1b

What is the difference between a CSS rule with an element selector (i.e. h1,p,div etc.) and one with a class selector (i.e. .task, .task-done etc.)? 

The CSS rules of element selector are built into HTML to structure the page and not necesarilly stylize the page, but using the class selectors CSS gives the user the ability to better stylize their page.

When would you use each?

We would use element selectors to structure a page and class selectors to modify multiple linked elements.

What are the advantages of putting your styles in a separate .css stylesheet instead of in the style element of head?

The advantages of putting styles in .css is that it declutters the .html page, it allows for more style freedoms, and it also gives more control to creating and managing variables.

How do web browsers choose which CSS to use for an HTML element when the CSS rules contradict each other?

When the CSS rules contradict, the web browsers use a set of rules that determines which rules to apply.

What is the order of precedence for CSS rules?

The order of CSS rules is: Importance, Specificity, Source, then Inheritance.

Why should you disable directory access for your server?

Disabling directory access is importnat to the sercer so that unauthorized individuals do not access the elements controlling the website and the content of the directories.
